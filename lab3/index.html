			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we were asked to structure format and organize our local file structure  for art 101. This included editing 
						parts of the art 101 index.html, as well as the lab 3 index.html, along with various other files like
						adding images and using css to format that image.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this particular lab things were mostly straightforward and easy. I had a little trouble editing my portrait on my homepage,
						but after changing the image ID I was able to quickly and easily solve this problem. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After completing this lab I feel as though I have a much better understanding of how to navigate and organize my local file 
						structure, something I had never put much thought into. Using VS code will now be muchh easier for me as I can locate 
						various data that I may need in a more structured way.
					</p>
