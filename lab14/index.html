            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p> The challenge of this lab was to go back through previous labs and debug issues that were present.

    <div ID="problems" class="special-sections">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> I had little to no issues, as I knew onkly one of my labs had a feature that did not work and it was a 
                relatively easy process getting it to work.

    <div ID="results" class="special-sections">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p> This lab resulted in me geting the chance to edit some previous mistakes, as well as allowing me 
                to learn how a similar mistake could be prevented in the future.

                For this lab I had a lot of trouble getting the pattern to show up, previously only the color 
                of the text would change. However this was an extremely simple solution and only required switching 
                the placement of the special and special-sections of the css, and it worked perfectly. At times 
                I would figure out how to make the pattern appear, but usually it would end up
                appearing on the entire page itself rather than each individual section. However, now clicking a button
                only activates the pattern for its section, as it's meant to.
