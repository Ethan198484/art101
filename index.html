					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello ! My name is Ethan, and I am someone who absolutely loves art. I have always been interested
						in reading, and when I started to learn how to play instruments it quickly became a large passion of mine.
						Although my main focus (somewhat) is music, art forms of all types peak my interest greatly and
						I love being able to explore those different forms. I also like games like fallout, soulsborne, god of war, 
						and various nintendo games, as well as being a somewhat adamant manga reader (Monster, Goodnight Punpun, Jojos, 
						Berserk.) Overall I'm pretty excited to be in this class because I feel like it has a lot of things
						for me to explore and learn about that are in line with my interests.
					</p>
