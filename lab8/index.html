        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>Along with a partner we were asked to create a lab 8 that consisted of callbbacks and functions.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>As I'm still getting used to functions and callbacks, it took me a bit of relearning to be able to understand how to perform
                the tasks involved. However it was nothing too complex and I was able to easily debug using the console.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I feel more confident in my ability to utilize callbacks and functions and the results can be seen in this lab.</p>
        </div>
