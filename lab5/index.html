					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to incorporate variables in java script, as well as working in our browsers console.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I missed the first class where we talked abut these strategies, so most of it was pretty confusing. However with
						the help of wesbot and my peers I was able to work through the problems I had.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went pretty well for me and I had a lot of enthusiasm, even if it was a bit 
						difficult. I had to learn most of the material as I worked on the lab,
					but that hands on aspect only makes  me feel as though I finished 
					with a much better understanding of the material at hand.
