            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p> The challenge of this lab was to experiment with API's and AJAX in order to design our own comic 
                page.

            </p>

    <div ID="problems" class="special-sections">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> I had trouble getting the API to load, so i instead created my own comic essentially and included
                an image in the js that would link to html.

            </p>

    </div>

    <div ID="results" class="special-sections">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p> This resulted in me learning skills in regards to handling situations when things don't go 
                according to plan and pushed me to develop my problem solving skills.
