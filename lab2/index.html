			<h1> Hello World</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Lab Challenge</h2>
					<p>Hello! My name is Ethan, and I am currently 
						a second year literature major with a passion 
						for music, writing, and art styles of all sorts. 
						I have been a musician for years now and consider
						it a core part of who I am. This class already interests me very much,
						and while I have little to no coding experience I feel as though a more artistic 
						approach is a perfect starting place for me to actually feel engaged.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a few issues arise when it came to the css formatting, including backgroud colors, font sizes, and margins.
						I was able to contiue experimenting and looking at my previous attempts to find out how certain aspects functioned 
						and was able to design the html.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was fun! I came with a very open attitude and gave myself hours of time to work on it,
			         exploring vs code's html and css functions to learn as I go along.
	                 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is a cool class and I love art !</p>
