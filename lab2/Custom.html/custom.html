    <h1> 
        Hello World
</h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Ethan, and I am currently 
    a second year literature major with a passion 
    for music, writing, and art styles of all sorts. 
    I have been a musician for years now and consider
    it a core part of who I am. This class already interests me very much,
    and while I have little to no coding experience I feel as though a more artistic 
    approach is a perfect starting place for me to actually feel engaged.
