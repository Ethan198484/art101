            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p> The challenge of this lab is to experiment with conditionals using various aspects of js like 
                functions, arrays, and objects.

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> I had some problems when it came to understanding how the functions
                worked as well as how to code them, but by checking my notes and asking wes bot it was all 
                solved with little to no trouble.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p> This lab was super fun to be creative with when it came to the lore that we were able to use.
                I've been watching a lot of Twin Peaks lately and have been a huge fan of David Lynch my 
                whole life, so it was nice to bring that into coding and have fun with it.
